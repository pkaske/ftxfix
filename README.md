# TV Enhance
Chrome Extension to make working with TradingView charts a little bit more intuitive.

## What can it do
So far you're able to set custom keyboard shortcuts for drawing tools and some chart settings.

## How to develop
First install dependencies with `yarn install`.

There is a gulp script that builds the contents of the options page as soon as something changes.
Run it with `npm run dev`.

Load the project as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
